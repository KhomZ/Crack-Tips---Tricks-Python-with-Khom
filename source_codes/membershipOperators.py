# Membership Operators:
# Algorithms develop and become optimized over time as a result of constant evolution and the need to 
# find the most efficient solutions for underlying problems in different domains.


# These Operators cand be used with any iterable data structure in Python, including Strings, Lists, and Tuples.



# -> in :- returns True if the given element is a part of the structure

op1 = 'apple' in ['orange', 'apple', 'grape']
print(op1)



# -> not in :- returns True if the given element is not a part of the structure.

op2 = 't' in 'stackabuse'
print(op2)
