Variables

1. Reserved memory location to store values.
2. You can think variable as labels with name on it attached to values.
3. In python variables do not need explicit declaration.
4. Assigning variables makes coding easy.
5. In python we can do multiple assignments simultaneously.


Rules for Assigning a Variable
1. Variable names can not start with numbers.
2. There are no spaces in variable names, we use _instead.
3. Variable name only consists of alpha-numeric characters(A-Z, 0-9)
or underscore(_)
4. Variable names are case sensitive. Eg- Name, name, NaMe, NAME these are three different variables.
